    <h2>Rick Caraviello, candidate for Mayor</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1a. For decades, cities and towns in the Greater Boston Area (including Medford) have failed to produce an adequate supply of housing to meet increasing demand. Do you believe Medford has an obligation to address this by supporting the creation of additional housing stock within the city?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>(NO ANSWER)</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. How would you respond to major development proposals (e.g., proposals using chapter 40B) that would contribute significantly toward increasing Medford’s housing supply?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>First and foremost, in order to adequately and efficiently respond to proposals for development in Medford, we need to fill the crucial positions in City Hall including Chief Financial Officer and Economic Development Director, and City Solicitor. I believe chapter 40B proposals that are friendly to developers are crucial to increasing Medford’s housing supply and making it affordable for families to live here.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>First and foremost, in order to adequately and efficiently respond to proposals for development in Medford, we need to fill the crucial positions in City Hall including Chief Financial Officer and Economic Development Director, and City Solicitor. I believe chapter 40B proposals that are friendly to developers are crucial to increasing Medford’s housing supply and making it affordable for families to live here.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>The Medford City Council passed an ordinance prohibiting short term rentals, and the current administration is not enforcing it. As a result, vital housing units needed for Medford families are being rented well above market rent on a short term basis, driving up the costs for everyone. Simply enforcing the existing rules will go a long way to mitigate the rising cost of housing and displacement for residents.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>Ending homelessness requires a total community response. If elected mayor, my administration would prioritize connecting those residents experiencing homelessness with the appropriate resources they need to regain safe sustainable housing. I would also pursue grant opportunities at the federal and state level.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>As stated above, the city should enforce the ban on short term rental housing to help reduce the strain on Medford housing and rental prices.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. Low-income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>A central part of my campaign is making Medford a welcoming community for every resident, whether that be home-owners, renters, residents of public housing, or anything in between. As stated above, I support a Resident Opportunity and Self-Sufficiency Program. This means supporting public housing residents to make progress toward achieving economic self-sufficiency by way of educational opportunities, job training, and parenting support resources.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>I believe that the Affordable Housing Trust Fund has been a great step in the right direction for affordable housing in our community. As a City Council member, I voted in favor of its establishment. For funding, I support a real estate transfer fee on the sale of property and setting a percentage of the city’s Community Preservation Act funds to the trust. These are ways to ensure the Fund has adequate resources without discouraging development.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9a. Would you support the dedication of City-owned property to create affordable housing?</p>
    <h3>Rick Caraviello's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>

    <h2>Breanna Lungo-Koehn, candidate for Mayor</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1a. For decades, cities and towns in the Greater Boston Area (including Medford) have failed to produce an adequate supply of housing to meet increasing demand. Do you believe Medford has an obligation to address this by supporting the creation of additional housing stock within the city?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>We have a housing crisis across our Commonwealth and the City of Medford is no exception. My team and I have been diligently working on addressing this crisis during my time in office, establishing Medford’s first Housing Production Plan that documents our current housing needs and recommends ways to create a mix of housing types for different income levels, kicking off a Comprehensive Planning process to set a shared vision for Medford's growth, and calculating Medford’s General Land Area Minimum, known as (GLAM), qualifying Medford for Safe Harbor status and giving the City a voice and a seat at the table with respect to large-scale residential developments (40Bs). That allowed us to negotiate a 350 unit development where 88 units will be affordable. We have more work to do, but I am committed to working with the city council, state leaders and local stakeholders to increase our housing supply and ensure our community is an affordable place to live.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. How would you respond to major development proposals (e.g., proposals using chapter 40B) that would contribute significantly toward increasing Medford’s housing supply?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>We know that to reach our housing goals we need to move our City towards smart growth, which includes prioritizing building more density near public transit. In our Housing Production Plan, the City’s first ever plan to outline how we can meet Medford’s current and future housing needs in the future, it identifies ways we can move major development proposals forward in a strategic way. I was also able to calculate Medford’s General Land Area Minimum, known as (GLAM), qualifying Medford for Safe Harbor status and giving the City a voice and a seat at the table with respect to large-scale residential developments (40Bs).</p>
<p>Also, we are not only responding to major developments, we are working towards bringing more into Medford, especially to create more housing. Two examples of that are our work on the vacant lots in medford Square and the RFI we did on the 28 acres of air rights we own above the Wellington T station.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>The single most pressing issue facing Medford is the rising cost of living, especially the cost of housing. We urgently need to build more housing that is affordable to our community, attract smart growth and economic development to increase our tax base, and update our antiquated zoning laws, all while preserving the character of our neighborhoods.</p>
<p>We know we can’t do this extensive work alone. That’s why we’ve leveraged $400,000 in federal grant funding to support the Medford Housing Authority’s renovation projects at 121 Riverside Avenue and Walkling Court which will add close to 125 new affordable housing units to the two facilities.</p>
<p>I worked with the City Council and Department heads to craft a new zoning ordinance that was adopted last year. Thanks to this collaborative work, we are now requiring more community input during the development process. The new ordinance provides a clear and concise roadmap for future construction projects to follow that adhere to the my administration’s priorities of community engagement and smart, sustainable development.</p>
<p>I worked with the City Council to establish a new zoning district, called a Planned Development District, which encourages proposals that specify a mixture of commercial, industrial, residential, open space or other uses. I am thrilled that due to this effort on expanding housing options, there are seven housing development projects currently underway that will add nearly 500 new units onto the market. This is just the beginning but by prioritizing smart, sustainable housing and commercial growth, we’re doing all we can to keep families, workers and our seniors here in Medford.</p>
<p>We have made great strides by creating our Housing Production Plan to recommend ways to create a mix of housing types for different income levels.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>There is a lot the City can do to support households struggling with the cost of living or facing displacement. During my time as Mayor, we have secured a Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant from the state. This was a major win for the City and is helping our residents adapt to a variety of critical health and economic issues. We help financially support work that ABCD and Housing families do for our residents. We had a seminar for our residents where agencies supporting their needs, presented and educated. We have used ARPA funding on mailers to let Tenants know their rights and what the city and agencies have to offer. We can also take steps like the most recently approved notification ordinance that the city council passed.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>Similar to my above answer, the City has taken critical action to help residents dealing with housing and economic instability. From securing the Municipal Vulnerability Preparedness Grant from the state, helping our residents adapt to a variety of critical health and economic issues to funding the work ABCD and Housing families do for our residents, we have focused on addressing the most urgent needs directly. As I mentioned, we also had a seminar for our residents where agencies supporting their needs provided critical information, worked with the City Hall on their notification ordinance, and used ARPA funding to educate tenants on their rights and potential supports available. I will continue to do everything I can to prevent homelessness and housing insecurity for Medford</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>The City can continue to educate residents about their housing rights and ensure they know they have resources available to them. We also can enforce our housing standards and address complaints with landlords or companies known to be violating tenant rights.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. Low-income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>As mayor, I was proud to support renovations and expansions of units at our Housing Authority Facilities to improve conditions and create more affordable housing within our community. We were able to secure and allocate hundreds of thousands in grant funding and ARPA funds to reduce the burden on taxpayers, while making these long-overdue investments. I will continue to prioritize our public housing as your mayor. By supporting the housing authority they are adding close to 125 new units and rehabbing the rest at the Riverside Ave and Walkling court locations.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Breanna Lungo-Koehn's answer</h3>
<p>By selling some vacant lots and putting that funding into the Trust, we would be able to build on other city owned lots. We are exploring all of this now and will continue to find ways to fund the trust.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9a. Would you support the dedication of City-owned property to create affordable housing?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1a. For decades, cities and towns in the Greater Boston Area (including Medford) have failed to produce an adequate supply of housing to meet increasing demand. Do you believe Medford has an obligation to address this by supporting the creation of additional housing stock within the city?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>(NO ANSWER)</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Housing is a human right, and municipalities must do whatever is within their power to make that right a reality for everyone. I strongly support zoning reforms to increase density, eliminate exclusionary zoning provisions, require more deed-restricted affordable housing, and incentivize further construction of deed-restricted affordable housing where requirements aren’t feasible or allowed under the law.</p>
<p>I also support a number of home rule petitions to the MA Legislature to give municipalities significantly more power, particularly to implement rent control, tenant right to counsel, just cause evictions, transfer fees on high-wealth homes, and ideally, an end to the restrictive Prop 2.5 property tax regime.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>First and foremost, the city needs to take a strong position and demand that state government fully fund rental assistance, pass tenants rights legislation, and pass local option laws to allow rent control, transfer fees, and right of first refusal. The lack of funding for city services and affordable housing is one of the biggest negative impacts on people who are being pushed out by the displacement crisis. Truly supporting people who are being displaced means: (1) funding an Office of Housing Stability to provide direct services and manage cases, (2) surging funding to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund by finding new revenue sources, (3) building strong connections and relationships with non-profit affordable housing developers, and (4) bringing a one-stop location for social service organizations into Medford to help people access all forms of private, city, state, and federal assistance programs and resources.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Much of my above plan for preventing displacement also assists people facing homelessness. But, people who are going unhoused face different circumstances and require more resources. The city needs to work with our neighbors to bring a warming center and shelter into Medford. Pairing this with the one-stop shop for social service organizations would significantly improve our ability to help people find permanent housing.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Once again, the City of Medford's lack of financial resources significantly limits active enforcement of fair housing. We need to invest in Medford by creating an Office of Housing Stability with case managers to support residents dealing with fair housing.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>The city needs to continue and expand our partnership with the MHA to access more LIHTC funds for rehabilitation and expansion of MHA properties. Walkling Court and Saltonstall Building are great examples of where we need to go. Significant new density at Laprise Village and Exchange Ave could help public housing communities become anchors of larger redevelopments of the Mystic Valley Parkway and Mystic Ave corridors.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6b. Would you support zoning changes or special permits to facilitate development of new public housing or low-income housing? </p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Zac Bears's answer</h3>
<p>Right now, our major tools are permit fees, CPA funding, and contributions from development projects. I would like to see the State House pass a local option transfer fee bill to allow Medford to fund the AHT through a fee on sales of high priced houses. Additionally, I would support using the general fund operating budget to fund the AHT, and would like to see this contribution grow overtime as the city grows and we see increases to the property tax levy.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1a. For decades, cities and towns in the Greater Boston Area (including Medford) have failed to produce an adequate supply of housing to meet increasing demand. Do you believe Medford has an obligation to address this by supporting the creation of additional housing stock within the city?</p>

<p>(NO ANSWER)</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>My general take on housing is to think about root problems, and to think beyond policy to an understanding of how real change actually happens. Many of the things we want to pass in Medford, like transfer fees or tenants' opportunity to purchase, require state approval (via Home Rule Petitions or state enabling legislation). How can we pass these laws if the state won’t let us? Through a statewide organization, I have helped with the formation of a pro-bono legal team whose mission is to help cities across Massachusetts pass progressive legislation with the goal of passing similar legislation in many cities at once. This will allow us to put pressure on the state and get enabling legislation passed more quickly. In the meantime, we take action on everything we can do today. As far as root problems go, housing as a for-profit commodity is a root problem which we can begin to tackle through ideas like social housing and rental/landlord licensing programs.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>A robust Office of Housing Stability can provide information for tenants on their rights, assist them in finding legal counsel, support tenant unions, assist with foreclosure prevention, provide help with section 8 housing applications, and help residents access any available rental assistance funds.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>I would have information available for people about nearby shelters and assistance centers like the Somerville Homeless Coalition and the Malden Warming Center. I also want Medford to have something like the Somerville Workforce and Talent Development program where people looking for work in our city can access training and job openings.</p>

<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Families with small children are often discriminated against, as well as people of color, immigrants, the LGBTQ+ community, and others. All landlords should be reminded of the laws and that these laws will be enforced. I support providing “test” renters when this comes up, people who apply with the same basic application details except for the quality in question, to see if the landlord is discriminating (potentially facilitated through the Office of Housing Stability).</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Our public housing is in need of renovation and sound-proofing. Public housing residents I have talked to also request more activities for youth. We need to use federal, state, and local funding to renovate, expand, and improve our public housing. And we should expand the library and Medford Rec activities for pre-teens and teens.</p>

<p>7. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Funds for the trust can come from a variety of sources: Community Preservation Act, linkage fees and transfer fees, short-term rental fees, and state and federal funds (like Community Development Block Grant funds).</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8a. Would you support the dedication of City-owned property to create affordable housing?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>I support the city of Medford creating mixed-income housing that has large proportions of affordable housing at multiple levels. City-owned (or owned by a non-profit affiliated with the city), mixed-income housing can encourage current homeowners to sell to owner-occupants, and free up some of our older housing stock.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9a. Following the completion of the Comprehensive Plan and the recent zoning recodification process, the Medford City Council has announced their intention to overhaul Medford’s zoning ordinance.</p>
<p>Do you support updating zoning so every neighborhood can grow moderately denser, taller, and more mixed-use than it is today?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>I support growing taller and more mixed use, and allowing more multi-family housing in areas currently zoned smaller (one- or two-unit areas become three-unit areas, for example). Density should not come at the cost of trees and parks – we have plenty of room to grow without sacrificing green space.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9c. As an example of a zoning change that could increase density and lower the cost of housing, do you support eliminating parking minimums city-wide? </p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>City-wide elimination with occasional exceptions based on data</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9d. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Blanket parking minimums are detrimental because they mandate wasted space in many parts of the city that do not need these minimums, space that could be used for green space or housing. I believe in eliminating parking minimums throughout most of the city, but I do believe there can be micro-neighborhood exceptions. I want to base decisions on data, and there may be parts of the city where high density and lack of other transit options might mean that a micro-neighborhood parking minimum makes sense. Any parking minimums should be the exception, not the rule.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9e. What other zoning changes do you support, and why?</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>Zoning should allow for higher density closer to transit hubs and also higher density near Tufts University; relaxed zoning for 100% affordable housing; allowance of ADUs throughout the city.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10. Some nearby cities and towns have proposed or plan to propose Home Rule Petitions to enact new housing policies, such as a real estate transfer fee, rent control or stabilization, and a Tenant Opportunity to Purchase program. For each policy, please indicate your agreement with the following statements by checking all that apply.</p>
<p>10a. Real estate transfer fee</p>
<p>This is a one-time fee levied on high-end real estate transactions above a certain amount. The fee percentage, sale amount threshold, and any exemptions can be determined by the City.</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer (candidates were given several options to choose from)</h3>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I personally support a real estate transfer fee</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would advocate for real estate transfer fee policy to the state legislature</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would support enacting a real estate transfer fee locally if legislation passes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>I run a podcast on state politics; please see our episode on housing: https://youtu.be/ojkvGveIiiU</p>
<p>Small transfer fees, especially when levied on buyers who are not owner-occupants, are good for increasing funding for an Affordable Housing Trust. If the state would allow it, I would support higher transfer fees on “flippers” who purchase a house, renovate, and then sell for a much higher price in an effort to dis-incentivize this behavior (and also fund the trust).</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10c. Rent control or rent stabilization</p>
<p>This encompasses a range of possible policies that aim to restrict how much landlords can increase rent. The level of allowed increase, exemptions, and many other factors can be determined by the City. </p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10e. Tenant Opportunity to Purchase (TOPA)</p>
<p>A typical TOPA law will inform tenants in multifamily buildings of the owner's intent to sell and provide them the first opportunity to collectively purchase the building before it is put on the open market. </p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer (candidates were given several options to choose from)</h3>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I personally support this</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would advocate for this to the state legislature</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would support enacting this locally if legislation passes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10f. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Anna Callahan's answer</h3>
<p>TOPA is an incredibly important way to keep tenants in their homes and create permanently affordable housing.</p>

    <h2>Charles Patrick Clerkin, candidate for City Council</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1a. For decades, cities and towns in the Greater Boston Area (including Medford) have failed to produce an adequate supply of housing to meet increasing demand. Do you believe Medford has an obligation to address this by supporting the creation of additional housing stock within the city?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>There needs to be adequate higher density housing that works with other development goals such as workspaces, parks, nightlife and historical preservation while not destroying the integrity of neighborhoods.</p>
<p>There needs means for neighbors in lower density housing and higher density buildings to engage with community. Lastly this needs to be through a balance of top-down and bottom-up measures to make sure things are neither too controlled nor too chaotic.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>I will emphasize ideas that look at the issue more than one step ahead and not exclusively head-on.</p>
<p>Development of housing units on Mystic Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway are two options which would address the shortage. But if any lower cost housing is to be built in this area it must also be accompanied by regulations and resources which prevent deterioration into a slum tenement.</p>
<p>Medford must work with management of any buildings and management must work with tenants to address their issues or if necessary, evict them. Compassion is important but too much is as poisonous as too little.</p>
<p>On another note, I see the combination of rent control and prop 2.5 override as being a shortsighted but understandable response to inflation, which I ultimately disagree with.</p>
<p>What some don't realize is that it will squeeze homeowners on fixed budgets into selling and moving elsewhere, while new residents will be less interested in buying. This will consolidate property in the hands of large commercial developers and therefore accelerate the gentrification process that many supporters are hoping to prevent.</p>
<p>My response is a diverse revenue package that doesn't overly rely on taxes but also bonds, grants, donations and improvements such as addressing outstanding lawsuits that which hang over the city.</p>
<p>I believe that not all problems are addressed directly so I also advocate coming to the table with Medford's large institutions such as Tufts and Chevalier. It's in their interest that the community around them thrive and that their students don't feel that their education is at the expense of their surroundings.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Throughout the various projects I've worked on I continuously find a lack of centralized information repository and/or poor advertising for it.</p>
<p>There needs to be a local paper distributed to a key location in each precinct. This will get critical information together alongside Medford's website. It's here that these resources for various groups can be expressed rather than scattered across website, social media and City Hall departments.</p>
<p>The city can also do a better job of encouraging civic participation among those who can afford. Incentivizing them to seek and compile resources into sections which can be added to the paper for those who are more focused on their day-to-day survival.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Considering their needs would be more immediate than what can be addressed with longer-term housing policies I'd consider presenting them with a package consisting of access to a soup kitchen and homeless shelter, a ticket to get there and some hygiene products.</p>
<p>Also referral to a social worker who are more equipped to handle deeper root causes and recommend areas of lower cost housing. I'd advocate that this tie in with state grants and national immigrations policies so that no one area becomes an attractant for accumulation of a homeless population.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Seek participants then convene a publicly viewable forum with well-informed representatives for homeowners, landlords, renters and developers. There must be intelligent, well-balanced moderation for a thoughtful conversation. The trust, funding and enthusiasm for all the above ideas is downstream from such a meeting.</p>
<p>The engaged portion of the Medford public must be made more broadly aware of each perspective so that a mutually agreeable definition of 'fair' can even be brought forth.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Proper waste disposal infrastructure including dumpsters and barrels that are emptied regularly. This must be tied to a precondition of residence along with the requirement of passing a drug and alcohol test and a behavior code as would befit the occupant of any group housing.</p>
<p>Residents must be able to take pride in their living space and eventually feel empowered to move beyond it. However, there exists a pathological form of support that acts as if any judgment or expectation is cruel and demeaning. This must be avoided so that low-income housing can truly be a hand up and a foundation for order in otherwise chaotic lives.</p>
<p>These residents must also be encouraged to give back to the Medford community by helping to enforce the rules on their own premise and attend local governance. Civic engagement will give them the sense of purpose and dignity which they might lack and a chance to show the skeptic residents of Medford that they are capable of being stable adults and families beyond their hard times.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6b. Would you support zoning changes or special permits to facilitate development of new public housing or low-income housing? </p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6c. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>This entirely depends on what the ripple effect of unintended consequences would be in each specific case. It also depends on the quality of the support that exists to go through with the zoning changes and special permits. Intentionally handicapped efforts are sometimes worse than none at all.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>I'd like to learn more about it in a context where I can ask questions. If I felt that it was thoughtfully assembled I'd support it by 1) making sure that applications for grants were annually submitted on its behalf 2) keeping the four stakeholder groups (homeowners, landlords, tenants and developers) informed at a bi-annual forum 3) make sure the donation process is easy and 4) provide well-advertised public updates on how the funds are used on the website or in print</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9a. Following the completion of the Comprehensive Plan and the recent zoning recodification process, the Medford City Council has announced their intention to overhaul Medford’s zoning ordinance.</p>
<p>Do you support updating zoning so every neighborhood can grow moderately denser, taller, and more mixed-use than it is today?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>It really depends what is meant by 'moderately' but I think when neighborhoods become too mixed with types of housing it will create infrastructural issues and heighten tension among forcefully-integrated neighborhoods.</p>
<p>While I think that cultural integration has been a noble and worthwhile goal, there are altogether different considerations when it comes to infrastructural integration.</p>
<p>I could be wrong and I am open to hear more but I'd like to see an organized overview of the zoning changes that isn't laden with legal jargon.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9c. As an example of a zoning change that could increase density and lower the cost of housing, do you support eliminating parking minimums city-wide? </p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Not sure what eliminating parking minimums means</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9d. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>Parking already has enforcement and volume issues. Anything requiring more cars per street is going to require building additional spillover lots for days with street sweeping, plowing and construction.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9e. What other zoning changes do you support, and why?</p>
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin's answer</h3>
<p>I'm not yet educated enough on zoning matters to present an informed stance, so I'll withhold for now.</p>

<p>I'd support this only if the tenant is made to show interest within 2 weeks of notification of the landlord's intent to sell.</p>
<p>On top of that, the tenant must be able to provide their creditworthiness for a loan from three financial institutions within a week of formally showing interest. If they aren't creditworthy or if the landlord would prefer to sell to a more worthy buyer the landlord may proceed on the open market.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>

<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Medford is a wonderful community. It is no wonder that people with deep roots here want to remain here, and that people from other places, near and far, wish to move here to work, study and put down roots. Embracing both current and future Medford residents means increasing the number of places to live in Medford.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>In Medford as elsewhere in the region, we are seeing historic escalations in housing costs and housing scarcity. Solving this problem requires action on many fronts.</p>
<p>In my first term I was proud to support and help pass a number of policies that address housing. I supported our Housing Production Plan, which is a wonderful guide for actions we can (and must) take at the City level. We have already begun a number of measures identified in the HPP. This term the City Council amended zoning to allow accessory dwelling units in more residential areas. This term we also passed the City’s new Affordable Housing Trust. To make this new Trust meaningful, the City must now develop dedicated funding streams, transfer in City-owned properties, and have adequate staff to recruit and work with affordable housing developers in our City. Affordable housing is notoriously difficult and expensive to build, and it will not happen in Medford at the rate we need it to unless we put real resources towards positioning ourselves for affordable housing development and recruiting the partners to build it.</p>
<p>The City Council will soon begin a decades-in-the-making zoning overhaul, which I have been a strong advocate for. This will be our opportunity to amend zoning to encourage multi-family housing, mixed-use development, an affordable housing overlay, and amend our zoning map to encourage denser housing in certain neighborhoods and corridors. This is one of the more impactful ways that we can zone our City for the type of housing that current demand requires, and that will dovetail with commercial development to create vibrant neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Many local housing affordability mechanisms are controlled (and prevented) at the State level. Throughout my term I have been a vocal advocate for State legislation that would enable mechanisms like rent stabilization and TOPA through testifying to the State Legislature and working with community groups such as City Life/Vida Urbana to advocate for needed changes that will give us more latitude at the local level to preserve our community and improve affordability.</p>
<p>I am proud of Medford’s public housing, and especially of the MHA’s investment in expanding and improving existing public housing. I have taken every opportunity to support MHA initiatives to renovate and expand its stock of public housing units and I will continue to advocate for expanded, high-quality public housing to better serve our community.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Currently, the City has incredibly scarce resources for households that are struggling with housing costs or displacement. To our shame, the City has to refer residents struggling with these problems to regional nonprofits and NGOs, which near-constantly have incredibly long waitlists of people who need this type of aid. The City must bring housing stability services in-house instead of referring residents to nonprofits that are already overburdened. I advocate for developing and allocating resources towards an Office of Housing Stability so that when residents facing housing issues or displacement find themselves in those situations, there is actually somewhere in City Hall where they can find help.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Knowing that the City does not itself hold sufficient resources to meaningfully assist residents encountering housing instability, I work with residents to connect them with local nonprofits, organizations, and experts that offer emergency rental assistance, legal assistance, or organizing support. When residents do not know where to turn or who to ask for help, I seek to serve as a liaison who can connect them with the right people and resources based on what they need at that moment.</p>
<p>In my first term I have (unfortunately) had a few opportunities to work with Medford households who are experiencing housing instability. For example, when notices to quit were issued en masse to residents of a Bradlee Road apartment building, I helped the tenants in their efforts to stay in their homes and negotiate a just resolution – because in a moment of unprecedented housing costs and scarcity, having to get out in 30 days assures displacement from the community. I helped connect the tenants with a housing justice organization, and liaised and supported their year-plus-long efforts to negotiate with their property owners and achieve a just resolution. When we run into the end of our local jurisdiction to affect housing outcomes, at the very least it is our responsibility to be there for our constituents, and assert that they belong here and their presence in our community must be protected. At the same time, we must advocate for State-level legislative changes that will strengthen local protections and resources for tenants and people facing housing instability.</p>
<p>This term, I helped pass a Housing Stability Notification Ordinance to ensure that more tenants across Medford are informed of their housing rights and local resources – before they need them.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Section 8 voucher holders are particularly susceptible to violations of fair housing choice. The City’s Housing Production Plan recommends conducting an updated analysis of barriers to fair housing in Medford to better understand local obstacles for voucher holders finding rentals in our community. Certainly, improved communication and enforcement would help – making sure that all voucher holders know their rights, and that landlords know the consequences for rejecting voucher holders as tenants – and the City has a demonstrated need for better communication and enforcement across the board. In addition, the City should restart the federally-funded housing rehabilitation program and target that funding at units that do not yet comply with HUD Housing Quality Standards, so that those properties may be brought up to eligibility for Section 8 rentals. We currently have a lot of untapped potential in the form of rental units that are not up to HUD standards and are held by landlords that would be happy to accept Section 8 vouchers if they could afford to make their rentals eligible.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>I am proud of the amount of public housing in Medford, and acknowledge that it must be expanded and much of it must be renovated, made accessible and otherwise improved. In my first term, I have consistently supported MHA projects to expand public housing Medford and consistently voted to appropriate CPA and other grant funding to support and enable these projects. I am happy to see Medford on a trajectory of making its public housing more available, more accessible, and more diversified – we must become a leader for the rest of the state in how to sustain abundant, accessible, and modern public housing.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6b. Would you support zoning changes or special permits to facilitate development of new public housing or low-income housing? </p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6c. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>I am strongly in favor of zoning and permitting measures such as an Affordable Housing Overlay that will make it more frictionless to build public and affordable housing in Medford. These are some of the most desperately-needed types of housing in our community, and also some of the most cumbersome and expensive to build. We have a responsibility to make it as easy as possible to build affordable and public housing, so that we may more quickly achieve our goals of housing community neighbors of all backgrounds and income levels.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>I would support funding the Affordable Housing Trust through appropriations from Community Preservation Act funding, and permitting/mitigation fees from the Condo Conversion Ordinance, should it pass (currently being worked on in subcommittee). I support inclusionary zoning, linkage, and short-term rentals fees being dedicated to the AHT. I am a strong proponent of real estate transfer fees and if the state enables us to enact one, that would be an appropriate and meaningful funding source. I believe our current PILOT agreements with Tufts University and other area nonprofits are insufficient; among other benefits, directing payments into the AHT would start to level the balance.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8a. Would you support the dedication of City-owned property to create affordable housing?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>The City currently has many underutilized properties of different types that would serve a huge community benefit if they were developed as affordable housing. It is important to create affordable housing in general, and permanently affordable housing specifically. By developing public lots into affordable housing and transferring these into the Affordable Housing Trust, we can create and protect affordable housing for the long term.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9a. Following the completion of the Comprehensive Plan and the recent zoning recodification process, the Medford City Council has announced their intention to overhaul Medford’s zoning ordinance.</p>
<p>Do you support updating zoning so every neighborhood can grow moderately denser, taller, and more mixed-use than it is today?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Each neighborhood in Medford is different, but I think that there is room for appropriate evolution in each part of the community. There are some neighborhoods in Medford that are clearly calling out for bold densification and mixed-use development – for example, the underutilized commercial zones including Mystic Valley Parkway, as well as in South Medford, Medford Square and Hillsides. In our more straightforwardly residential areas, we can make it easier to augment existing infrastructure with affordable units, infill development on city-owned properties, and accessory dwelling units.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9c. As an example of a zoning change that could increase density and lower the cost of housing, do you support eliminating parking minimums city-wide? </p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9d. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Existing parking minimums are often out of step with actual need, tying up prime real estate that could be put to uses that are more aligned with community goals and needs like residential and business development, road redesign for better safety and walkability/bikeability, and green space. It is important that we reevaluate this current aspect of zoning and reduce/eliminate parking minima citywide to free up land use for these important other uses.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9e. What other zoning changes do you support, and why?</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>I support reevaluating current standards for permitted uses, density requirements, and height restrictions so as to allow smoother development of denser, taller residential buildings. These current zoning rules keep us from increasing our housing supply, and from densifying our housing supply in a way that hews to our climate goals and our goals of creating vibrant, mixed-use, walkable neighborhoods. I support an Affordable Housing Overlay to make creation of affordable housing easier citywide; and zoning to allow affordable infill development on vacant public lots in SF districts that can then be transferred into the Affordable Housing Trust. I’m currently at work on a Condo Conversion regulation which would create a mitigation structure when for-profit flippers take rental units off the market.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10. Some nearby cities and towns have proposed or plan to propose Home Rule Petitions to enact new housing policies, such as a real estate transfer fee, rent control or stabilization, and a Tenant Opportunity to Purchase program. For each policy, please indicate your agreement with the following statements by checking all that apply.</p>
<p>10a. Real estate transfer fee</p>
<p>This is a one-time fee levied on high-end real estate transactions above a certain amount. The fee percentage, sale amount threshold, and any exemptions can be determined by the City.</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer (candidates were given several options to choose from)</h3>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I personally support a real estate transfer fee</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would advocate for real estate transfer fee policy to the state legislature</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would support enacting a real estate transfer fee locally if legislation passes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Real estate transfer fees target high-end sales – where private money is being made off of the value of land in our community. When for-profit companies profit off of community assets, the community should profit too. So when high-value real estate changes hands in Medford it is only fair that a commission should go to the community to help pay for vital and historically underfunded community assets and programs. As a City, we would have the authority to tailor the specifics to enact a fee structure that is fair to the community and reasonable for transactors operating at this level.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10c. Rent control or rent stabilization</p>
<p>This encompasses a range of possible policies that aim to restrict how much landlords can increase rent. The level of allowed increase, exemptions, and many other factors can be determined by the City. </p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer (candidates were given several options to choose from)</h3>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I personally support rent control or rent stabilization</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would advocate for rent control or rent stabilization to the state legislature</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would support enacting rent control or rent stabilization locally if legislation passes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10d. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>The ban on rent control renders it illegal for local governments to enact meaningful and reasonable housing stability policies. Massachusetts’ failure to legalize rent control signals that commercial landlords’ profits are more important than residents’ financial and physical security. Failing to enact rent control condones leaving renters to the whims of an uncaring market. With wages lagging far behind gentrification and inflation, the lack of reasonable caps on rent increases causes displacement and homelessness.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10e. Tenant Opportunity to Purchase (TOPA)</p>
<p>A typical TOPA law will inform tenants in multifamily buildings of the owner's intent to sell and provide them the first opportunity to collectively purchase the building before it is put on the open market. </p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer (candidates were given several options to choose from)</h3>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I personally support this</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would advocate for this to the state legislature</p>
<p><big><big>&#9745;</big></big> I would support enacting this locally if legislation passes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>10f. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Kit Collins's answer</h3>
<p>Yes, I’m strongly in favor of TOPA and have testified in favor of it at the State level. It is a positive thing for individual households and the community overall when buildings remain in the hands of owner-occupiers instead of being gobbled up by large corporate landlords and for-profit flippers, which are increasingly encroaching upon our housing supply. Cities should be empowered to encourage and enable individual households to collectively purchase buildings so that residents are better able to remain in this community and not be displaced when buildings change hands. This is also an exciting way to encourage homeownership. I am working on including a tenant First Right of Refusal provision in the Condo Conversion Ordinance that is currently in subcommittee.</p>

    <h2>Emily Lazzaro, candidate for City Council</h2>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1a. For decades, cities and towns in the Greater Boston Area (including Medford) have failed to produce an adequate supply of housing to meet increasing demand. Do you believe Medford has an obligation to address this by supporting the creation of additional housing stock within the city?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1b. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>I believe Medford can and should provide enough housing to meet the demand in the city. Our proximity to Boston's jobs and attractions means that our city is appealing, and it is in our interest to provide affordable housing - that is one of many things that contributes to a thriving municipality. It is also environmentally responsible to have affordable housing close to places where people work, to cut down on travel obligations.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>I would support building higher density housing close to public transit. We need more housing, first and foremost, and it must be available at a variety of price points, not only luxury housing. I would also support ADUs and exceptions to parking space requirements as opportunities to increase housing supply.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3a. Have you personally known anyone who was forced to leave Medford due to the high cost of housing?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>3b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>Medford should establish an Office of Housing Stability, like Boston and Somerville. This office's focus will be providing services to residents to keep them in their homes.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Office of Housing Stability would help with this, but I also have many ideas as the Assistant Director of the Malden Warming Center, a seasonal homeless shelter in Malden. People dealing with homelessness or the threat of homelessness need both short-term and long-term assistance. This often is related to substance use disorder and addiction treatment/counseling, but not always. There are barriers to accessing housing if a person has a history of incarceration, for example, or they may be someone who is simply dealing with deep poverty. No matter the situation, wraparound services are useful. There are many wonderful non-profit organizations in our area, but a way to access a collection of services via the city would be a great starting point. Job listings, short term assistance (such as hotel vouchers), connections to places like Eliot Community Human Service, and recovery coaches are all useful. We need to give this issue the attention it deserves and recognize that there isn't a quick fix. We need to work at it, and we need to be stubborn until we have all the services in place that our community needs.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>No</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>I would need to look more deeply into this issue. I would recommend that undercover inspectors can pose as renters or perhaps section 8 recipients and see if landlords are willing to rent to them, but I am not sure if the city is already engaging in this type of work. I do not want to assume they are not.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>The Medford Housing Authority, like many departments in Medford, is under-funded. MHA needs more funding, and that can be accessed with an increase in property taxes via Property 2 1/2 override.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6b. Would you support zoning changes or special permits to facilitate development of new public housing or low-income housing? </p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>I would prioritize funding an Affordable Housing Trust Fund via any revenue streams we have in Medford, but we desperately need more revenue. Ideas to explore include a real estate transfer fee and funding from the community preservation committee.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>8a. Would you support the dedication of City-owned property to create affordable housing?</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9d. Please explain more (optional):</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>This city has been prioritizing car travel for many decades and it is time to update our city to where our culture and society are moving: toward more environmentally friendly modes of transport and more opportunities for housing.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9e. What other zoning changes do you support, and why?</p>
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro's answer</h3>
<p>I support zoning changes that will allow apartments to be built above existing businesses in Medford. I would also support building more high density high rise housing. We are an urban center and should have housing that reflects that.</p>

    <h3>Matt Leming's answer</h3>
<p>With regards to the private housing market, I'm open to any policies that discourage speculation by private equity forms and ownership by absentee landlords, without affecting renters, homeowners, and small, local landlords. The specific initiatives I would like to pursue are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Re-zoning. This would allow, among other things, for accessible dwelling units and building of residential properties on top of commercial storefronts (with incentives for the inclusion of more affordable units).</li>
  <li> Implementation of the recently-passed Affordable Housing Trust.</li>
  <li> Support and ensure the completion of the Walkling Court expansion.</li>
  <li> Submit a home-rule petition for a real-estate transfer fee that does not affect residents who live in their homes. This is to generally favor the implementation of policies that discourage ownership of family units by private equity firms and encourage ownership by both residents who live in their homes and local landlords.</li>
  <li> Increased housing staff in city hall, which will help with the development of affordable housing as well as the enforcement of many of our existing ordinances.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Matt Leming's answer</h3>
<p>Different tax exemptions and programs to help with this; the funding of rental assistance and legal aid programs; greater advertisement of the property tax deferral program for seniors; and more dedicated housing staff in city hall.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Matt Leming's answer</h3>
<p>Getting more revenue into the city so that we can have nonprofit/homeless support. Currently, Medford's go-to policy is referring people experiencing homelessness to neighboring municipalities.</p>

    <h3>Matt Leming's answer</h3>
<p>The very first thing we would need is hire more city inspectors (we have eight at the moment) to enforce our current ordinances, which are often ignored entirely.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Matt Leming's answer</h3>
<p>Leverage soft power to get funding at the state/federal level invested into Medford. There's a big push in Massachusetts at the moment to fund public housing. In the short-term, we would need to make sure that the Walkling Court redevelopment is implemented, and ensure that residents know about their options for temporary relocation to other public housing in Medford.</p>

    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>The housing crisis is shaking Medford, and it is urgent that we act swiftly and seriously to ensure that folks who want to come to Medford or stay in Medford can afford it. This is a problem that we know through stories of friends and family (and myself) wanting to stay in our city and through statistics, average rents for units are sky-high.</p>
<p>In acting swiftly and seriously, we must give ourselves all the tools in the toolbox. We must treat housing production as key, and my plan is to use the second phase of zoning reform as our main instrument in this upcoming term. Some of the goals I believe we should work on, and believe we can pass, in our next term include: 1) allowing for more mixed-used development and housing density, particularly in transit corridors and underdeveloped spaces like Route 16 and Mystic Ave; 2) allowing folks to have the freedom to choose whether to subdivide their single family houses into more units; 3) re-legalizing triple-deckers; 4) reducing (or even eliminating) parking minimums; 5) reviewing height and setback restrictions; 6) put in an affordable housing overlay; 7) allow for more units to be created with environmental/energy-efficient incentives; 8) review our affordable housing requirements and study the creation of a system where we might have different options with different AMIs for developers to choose from. Outside of zoning, I would continue to support efforts at the state level to return power to municipalities to help renters and new prospective homebuyers and to provide support for city staff to maximize grant application and funding for affordable housing.</p>

<p>3b. How can the City support households who are struggling with the escalating cost of housing and displacement from their homes?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>Over the long-term, I believe that the most important thing we can do to this end is to use zoning reform to boost housing production and to create a bigger tax base, with which we can provide more comprehensive, in-house social support to help residents afford housing and help prevent them against displacement. In the shorter term, I would continue to vote to fund nonprofits that help tenants and to provide funds to prevent displacement (be it through rental assistance, legal aid, etc.). I would vote to fund the Affordable Housing Trust which we passed this council term and would ensure that the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance which we passed this term as well is well-executed. I would support efforts to create an Office of Housing Stability and would continue to push our City to do better at communicating resources and rights, exploring different channels and languages.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>4. How would you serve Medford residents and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>I would work with our Board of Health, city social workers, and the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to tackle these issues and to provide support, be it legal or practical. I think we should dedicate more resources to reaching out to term and seeing what their needs are, which could range from food and clothing to connecting with legal and housing non-profits and job training. I would continue to vote to fund nonprofits that fight against displacement and homelessness and provide food and basics. I also plan to work to establish cooling and warming centers, particularly relevant given extreme weather and climate change and to build more, more accessible public toilets. I would advocate against hostile architecture. I would encourage the Mayor’s office to dedicate a small pool of money that we can use to make sure that food pantries are stocked. I also recognize that a bulk of these actions are geared more at the short-term, and I believe that it’ll take a regional effort – with cities like Medford taking the lead – to create the necessary housing and social protections for a more long-term fix.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5a. Have you personally known anyone who has encountered housing discrimination in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>Yes</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>5b. What can the City do to promote and enforce fair housing?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>We need to do more research as a city government into how housing discrimination manifests itself and how deeply it does so in our city today. I’ve been pushing our city to review its social justice roadmap, and I believe this would fit right into that roadmap. By knowing the facts, we can have a more targeted approach, particularly at a time of low resources. We should work with our Medford Housing Authority and local social justice/civil rights groups to be self-critical. We should also enhance mechanisms by which residents who have encountered housing discrimination can work with city staff to report and rectify the situation. We also have to realize that housing discrimination and the question of fair housing can be subtle and require much listening, nuance, and creativity to solve the problem.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>6a. Low income housing in Massachusetts has historically been under-resourced, and some of Medford’s public housing is in substandard condition. How would you support public housing residents?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>This is an issue which I hear from constituents about and which I see on sites like See Click Fix. I have been supporting efforts to upgrade and expand existing public housing at Walkling Court, the Saltonstall Building, and LaPrise Village, including dedicating monies from the Community Preservation Act Fund for this. I would continue to put residents in touch with authorities on these matters and to see what we can do to find the funding or urgency to deal with these issues. In the next term, I’d also want to push the City and City Council to hold more meetings and listening sessions in these spaces, so that we can hear and engage with residents directly.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>7. In 2023, Medford established an Affordable Housing Trust Fund. How would you support its funding?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>The Affordable Housing Trust is one of the most substantial wins of my first-term on the City Council and something I was proud to support and help pass. To support its funding, we should ensure during the budget process that there is money in the municipal budget that goes into this fund and dedicate Community Preservation Act funds to it. I’d also support seeing what we can dedicate to it with Community Development Block Grant funds. I would also be supportive of creating additional streams of funding dedicated to solving the housing crisis here in Medford, such as with transfer fees and linkage fees.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>9e. What other zoning changes do you support, and why?</p>
    <h3>Justin Tseng's answer</h3>
<p>My responses to questions 2 and 9A essentially capture my goal: upgrade our neighborhoods to allow for more density and housing units, particularly around our transit corridors, empty/under-utilized industrial spaces, and business districts. Tied in with this, I would relegalize buildings that have been made illegal in past rounds of zoning reform, like triple-deckers, give folks the freedom to decide whether or not they want to subdivide a large house into smaller units (for example after all their children move away), look at loosening up ADU regulations even more, take advantage of the intersection with environmental work (for example, incentivize developers to electrify by offering building incentives if they reach certain targets and densifying in less flood-prone area), and study the intersection of zoning with economic justice, looking at how we can adjust our affordability requirements and AMI targets to reach folks who are currently being left out because AMI is too high, perhaps creating a tiered system where developers have different options to reach affordability.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1. How would you use your role on the School Committee to support children and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Jenny Graham's answer</h3>
<p>We have lots of decisions to make in the coming years about district priorities. I will use my role to ensure that we properly support children and families experiencing housing instability and homelessness with resources within our school district. Our family and community engagement office is one specific part of the team that is intended to help connect families to school and other resources they might need to ensure their children are able to come to school and be healthy. This team is currently funded through pandemic Federal funding (ESSER), and it's one of my goals to ensure that the support created by this team can continue forward after the funding from the Federal government ends in the Summer of 2024. The needs of our students experiencing housing instability and homelessness won't be solved, and whatever transitions we make as a district need to preserve these services.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. Do you have anything else you would like to highlight or add regarding housing in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Jenny Graham's answer</h3>
<p>Over these last few years, we’ve seen the consequences of a lack of resources in our schools. Our building maintenance deferrals over the years delayed our ability to get kids back to school during the pandemic and most recently caused the HVAC systems at nearly every one of our schools to be non-functional during a September heat wave. The high school lacks infrastructure like air conditioning and reliable internet. The state of the high school bathrooms is a well-documented source of frustration for many.</p>
<p>In the coming year, we’ll face the end of pandemic Federal funding. Our current budget relies on that funding for more than 30 staff positions ranging from nurses to mental health support staff to administrators. How to move forward and advocate for the district and our students will be the School Committee's central work in the coming year. These positions aren't extra in most cases, and they are especially important when we think about families who may be experiencing housing instability.</p>
<p>Through our next budget cycle, I’ll push to do many of the same things I’ve pushed for over the last four years. We need to create a budget process to ensure that the budget we request reflects what we see as the needs of our students and district and that it happens more promptly. This dialogue is critically important, and I’m proud of my progress this far, but there is more to do. As the Mayor and the Council determine how to create the larger city budget more openly and collaboratively, I am ready to partner with them to ensure our Schools are a top priority where the needs of our city are being discussed.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1. How would you use your role on the School Committee to support children and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>John L. Intoppa's answer</h3>
<p>One of the major things on the platform is preventative mental health care. Students who are experiencing these circumstances are more susceptible to falling behind in class or health wise. By building these resources, we can do our part by not letting education add an even greater stress to the concerns outside of school. Continuing to build up resources like the BRYT program can help students continue with education after lengthened absences from school.</p>
<p>Another key point on the platform is building up our Center for Citizenship and Social Responsibility (CCSR) program. It currently receives a majority of funding from outside grants and is deserving of better attention from our elected officials. Students are taught social responsibility and how to give back to the community. In theory, by elevating this program - students may be able to help their fellow peers by building resources of their own in our community that is more designed and directed to current events.</p>

<p>1. How would you use your role on the School Committee to support children and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Aaron Olapade's answer</h3>
<p>As the issue of housing instability is a difficult topic to discuss and understand; the way in which it affects individuals and families differs greatly, I wish to acknowledge that my support and role as a school committee member will be to better educated and understand how to support those experiencing this, as well as put forth resolutions and initiatives to combat this systemic issue. Firstly, I would raise awareness of the growing issue in Medford; educate the community, school staff, and fellow committee members about the issue and how it presents differently in children and families. I would advocate for progressive policies to promote affordable housing, tenant protections, partnerships with organizations that deal with this issue. I would aim to conduct training days for our teachers and administrators so they are better equipped to recognize the signs of homelessness and instability and be able to provide guidance emotionally and academically. Advocate for better and cost effective transportation services so students are able to commute to and from school, and other locations within the city without fear of being unable to pay.</p>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1. How would you use your role on the School Committee to support children and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Erika Reinfeld's answer</h3>
<p>While requirements for such support are built into the McKinney-Vento Act on the federal level and administered with the assistance of liaisons and grants on the state level, the role of a school committee member lies in ensuring that district administration is appropriately engaging with available local resources (including the Medford Health Department) and that school staff have the resources and knowledge they need to support these students and families day to day. As a community, we have a responsibility to stabilize basic needs, destigmatize diverse housing situations, and proactively provide accessible pathways for navigating adversity. As a member of the Medford School Committee, I would:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Review policies and practices around such topics as attendance, homework, school supplies, school breakfast/snacks, recess, and new student enrollment to ensure they are not disadvantaging students experiencing housing instability</li>
  <li> Bolster before- and after-school services and extracurricular activities, while reducing the financial barriers for participation therein</li>
  <li> Assess the needs of teachers and other school staff in learning about strategies and resources for supporting this vulnerable yet resilient population, ensuring that reference materials and knowledgeable individuals are readily available</li>
  <li> Support teachers and staff members in developing learning experiences that provide a safe, empowering, welcoming environment for students from all walks of life to acknowledge vulnerability, express emotions, and exert control over their educational experiences</li>
  <li> Build a culture of empathy and awareness in our schools that reduces social stigma around housing instability and diverse living situations, respects students' dignity and privacy, and encourages all students to play an active role in their education</li>
  <li> Work with the district and city to update communication protocols with broader outreach and more targeted follow-up about school happenings, opportunities, and deadlines</li>

    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>1. How would you use your role on the School Committee to support children and families who are experiencing housing instability or homelessness?</p>
    <h3>Paul Ruseau's answer</h3>
<p>I will continue to focus on providing a free public education, which does not exist today. The impacts of the costs required to participate in our public education system are disproportionately felt by students experiencing housing instability or homelessness as these are a reflection of significant resource limitations by families. The Medford Public Schools requires at least an additional $2 million annually to provide a free public education, and while the School Committee cannot raise revenue in any way due to the structure of our government, continuing to raise this issue, and pushing back on attempts to take the approach of 'making funds available for students in need' will always be my view of how to serve our students humanely.</p>
    <h3>Question</h3>
<p>2. Do you have anything else you would like to highlight or add regarding housing in Medford?</p>
    <h3>Paul Ruseau's answer</h3>
<p>As you know, housing instability and homelessness impacts Medford students. McKinney-Vento, while mandating transportation, which I support, is really a failure. Students on shuttle buses from distant communities for hours each day, at a cost far greater than the cost of a very expensive single family home in Medford is astonishingly bad policy. It is far more expensive to have these students bused than BUYING a single family home, and it is terrible for students that must miss out on so many activities as they sit in traffic from distant communities.</p>
