    <h1>2024 Housing Medford Questionnaire: Candidates for City Council, arranged by question</h1>
<p>To inform voters of candidates' views on local housing issues, members of Housing Medford's Elections Working Group designed this questionnaire for candidates that highlights several housing issues currently relevant to Medford.</p>

<p>The questionnaire was sent on Tuesday, September 19th, and candidates were invited to answer these questions and submit their answers via Google Form by midnight on Tuesday, October 3rd 2023 (Mayoral candidates by Tuesday, October 10th). All candidates except George Scarpelli confirmed receipt of the questionnaire.</p>

<p>Some questions were open-ended, and some had multiple-choice options where candidates could indicate their support. For the multiple-choice questions they were also given the option to explain more in a follow-up.</p>

<p>Housing Medford will not endorse any candidates this election cycle, but we hope this information can be useful for Medford voters. We extend our sincere thanks to all candidates who took time to complete the questionnaire!"</p>

    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin [<a href="#QQ1b+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
    <p>[ Answer to <a href="#QQ1a+City_Council">main question</a>: Yes ]</p><p>There needs to be adequate higher density housing that works with other development goals such as workspaces, parks, nightlife and historical preservation while not destroying the integrity of neighborhoods.</p>
<p>There needs means for neighbors in lower density housing and higher density buildings to engage with community. Lastly this needs to be through a balance of top-down and bottom-up measures to make sure things are neither too controlled nor too chaotic.</p>

    <p>[ Answer to <a href="#QQ1a+City_Council">main question</a>: Yes ]</p><p>Medford is a wonderful community. It is no wonder that people with deep roots here want to remain here, and that people from other places, near and far, wish to move here to work, study and put down roots. Embracing both current and future Medford residents means increasing the number of places to live in Medford.</p>

    <p>[ Answer to <a href="#QQ1a+City_Council">main question</a>: Yes ]</p><p>I believe Medford can and should provide enough housing to meet the demand in the city. Our proximity to Boston's jobs and attractions means that our city is appealing, and it is in our interest to provide affordable housing - that is one of many things that contributes to a thriving municipality. It is also environmentally responsible to have affordable housing close to places where people work, to cut down on travel obligations.</p>

    <a name="QQ2+City_Council" />    <h2>Question</h2>
<p>2. There is currently a housing crisis across Massachusetts, as sale prices and rental costs rise far beyond what many people can afford, and Medford is no exception. In general, what approach will you take to address housing affordability in Medford?</p>
    <a name="2+City_CouncilZac_Bears" />
    <h3>Zac Bears [<a href="#QQ2+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Housing is a human right, and municipalities must do whatever is within their power to make that right a reality for everyone. I strongly support zoning reforms to increase density, eliminate exclusionary zoning provisions, require more deed-restricted affordable housing, and incentivize further construction of deed-restricted affordable housing where requirements aren’t feasible or allowed under the law.</p>
<p>I also support a number of home rule petitions to the MA Legislature to give municipalities significantly more power, particularly to implement rent control, tenant right to counsel, just cause evictions, transfer fees on high-wealth homes, and ideally, an end to the restrictive Prop 2.5 property tax regime.</p>
    <a name="2+City_CouncilAnna_Callahan" />
    <h3>Anna Callahan [<a href="#QQ2+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>My general take on housing is to think about root problems, and to think beyond policy to an understanding of how real change actually happens. Many of the things we want to pass in Medford, like transfer fees or tenants' opportunity to purchase, require state approval (via Home Rule Petitions or state enabling legislation). How can we pass these laws if the state won’t let us? Through a statewide organization, I have helped with the formation of a pro-bono legal team whose mission is to help cities across Massachusetts pass progressive legislation with the goal of passing similar legislation in many cities at once. This will allow us to put pressure on the state and get enabling legislation passed more quickly. In the meantime, we take action on everything we can do today. As far as root problems go, housing as a for-profit commodity is a root problem which we can begin to tackle through ideas like social housing and rental/landlord licensing programs.</p>
    <a name="2+City_CouncilCharles_Patrick_Clerkin" />
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin [<a href="#QQ2+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>I will emphasize ideas that look at the issue more than one step ahead and not exclusively head-on.</p>
<p>Development of housing units on Mystic Ave and Mystic Valley Parkway are two options which would address the shortage. But if any lower cost housing is to be built in this area it must also be accompanied by regulations and resources which prevent deterioration into a slum tenement.</p>
<p>Medford must work with management of any buildings and management must work with tenants to address their issues or if necessary, evict them. Compassion is important but too much is as poisonous as too little.</p>
<p>On another note, I see the combination of rent control and prop 2.5 override as being a shortsighted but understandable response to inflation, which I ultimately disagree with.</p>
<p>What some don't realize is that it will squeeze homeowners on fixed budgets into selling and moving elsewhere, while new residents will be less interested in buying. This will consolidate property in the hands of large commercial developers and therefore accelerate the gentrification process that many supporters are hoping to prevent.</p>
<p>My response is a diverse revenue package that doesn't overly rely on taxes but also bonds, grants, donations and improvements such as addressing outstanding lawsuits that which hang over the city.</p>
<p>I believe that not all problems are addressed directly so I also advocate coming to the table with Medford's large institutions such as Tufts and Chevalier. It's in their interest that the community around them thrive and that their students don't feel that their education is at the expense of their surroundings.</p>

    <h3>Kit Collins [<a href="#QQ2+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>In Medford as elsewhere in the region, we are seeing historic escalations in housing costs and housing scarcity. Solving this problem requires action on many fronts.</p>
<p>In my first term I was proud to support and help pass a number of policies that address housing. I supported our Housing Production Plan, which is a wonderful guide for actions we can (and must) take at the City level. We have already begun a number of measures identified in the HPP. This term the City Council amended zoning to allow accessory dwelling units in more residential areas. This term we also passed the City’s new Affordable Housing Trust. To make this new Trust meaningful, the City must now develop dedicated funding streams, transfer in City-owned properties, and have adequate staff to recruit and work with affordable housing developers in our City. Affordable housing is notoriously difficult and expensive to build, and it will not happen in Medford at the rate we need it to unless we put real resources towards positioning ourselves for affordable housing development and recruiting the partners to build it.</p>
<p>The City Council will soon begin a decades-in-the-making zoning overhaul, which I have been a strong advocate for. This will be our opportunity to amend zoning to encourage multi-family housing, mixed-use development, an affordable housing overlay, and amend our zoning map to encourage denser housing in certain neighborhoods and corridors. This is one of the more impactful ways that we can zone our City for the type of housing that current demand requires, and that will dovetail with commercial development to create vibrant neighborhoods.</p>
<p>Many local housing affordability mechanisms are controlled (and prevented) at the State level. Throughout my term I have been a vocal advocate for State legislation that would enable mechanisms like rent stabilization and TOPA through testifying to the State Legislature and working with community groups such as City Life/Vida Urbana to advocate for needed changes that will give us more latitude at the local level to preserve our community and improve affordability.</p>
<p>I am proud of Medford’s public housing, and especially of the MHA’s investment in expanding and improving existing public housing. I have taken every opportunity to support MHA initiatives to renovate and expand its stock of public housing units and I will continue to advocate for expanded, high-quality public housing to better serve our community.</p>

<p>With regards to the private housing market, I'm open to any policies that discourage speculation by private equity forms and ownership by absentee landlords, without affecting renters, homeowners, and small, local landlords. The specific initiatives I would like to pursue are:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Re-zoning. This would allow, among other things, for accessible dwelling units and building of residential properties on top of commercial storefronts (with incentives for the inclusion of more affordable units).</li>
  <li> Implementation of the recently-passed Affordable Housing Trust.</li>
  <li> Support and ensure the completion of the Walkling Court expansion.</li>
  <li> Submit a home-rule petition for a real-estate transfer fee that does not affect residents who live in their homes. This is to generally favor the implementation of policies that discourage ownership of family units by private equity firms and encourage ownership by both residents who live in their homes and local landlords.</li>
  <li> Increased housing staff in city hall, which will help with the development of affordable housing as well as the enforcement of many of our existing ordinances.</li>
</ul>

    <h3>Justin Tseng [<a href="#QQ2+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>The housing crisis is shaking Medford, and it is urgent that we act swiftly and seriously to ensure that folks who want to come to Medford or stay in Medford can afford it. This is a problem that we know through stories of friends and family (and myself) wanting to stay in our city and through statistics, average rents for units are sky-high.</p>
<p>In acting swiftly and seriously, we must give ourselves all the tools in the toolbox. We must treat housing production as key, and my plan is to use the second phase of zoning reform as our main instrument in this upcoming term. Some of the goals I believe we should work on, and believe we can pass, in our next term include: 1) allowing for more mixed-used development and housing density, particularly in transit corridors and underdeveloped spaces like Route 16 and Mystic Ave; 2) allowing folks to have the freedom to choose whether to subdivide their single family houses into more units; 3) re-legalizing triple-deckers; 4) reducing (or even eliminating) parking minimums; 5) reviewing height and setback restrictions; 6) put in an affordable housing overlay; 7) allow for more units to be created with environmental/energy-efficient incentives; 8) review our affordable housing requirements and study the creation of a system where we might have different options with different AMIs for developers to choose from. Outside of zoning, I would continue to support efforts at the state level to return power to municipalities to help renters and new prospective homebuyers and to provide support for city staff to maximize grant application and funding for affordable housing.</p>

    <a name="3b+City_CouncilZac_Bears" />
    <h3>Zac Bears [<a href="#QQ3b+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>First and foremost, the city needs to take a strong position and demand that state government fully fund rental assistance, pass tenants rights legislation, and pass local option laws to allow rent control, transfer fees, and right of first refusal. The lack of funding for city services and affordable housing is one of the biggest negative impacts on people who are being pushed out by the displacement crisis. Truly supporting people who are being displaced means: (1) funding an Office of Housing Stability to provide direct services and manage cases, (2) surging funding to the Affordable Housing Trust Fund by finding new revenue sources, (3) building strong connections and relationships with non-profit affordable housing developers, and (4) bringing a one-stop location for social service organizations into Medford to help people access all forms of private, city, state, and federal assistance programs and resources.</p>

    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin [<a href="#QQ3b+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Throughout the various projects I've worked on I continuously find a lack of centralized information repository and/or poor advertising for it.</p>
<p>There needs to be a local paper distributed to a key location in each precinct. This will get critical information together alongside Medford's website. It's here that these resources for various groups can be expressed rather than scattered across website, social media and City Hall departments.</p>
<p>The city can also do a better job of encouraging civic participation among those who can afford. Incentivizing them to seek and compile resources into sections which can be added to the paper for those who are more focused on their day-to-day survival.</p>
    <a name="3b+City_CouncilKit_Collins" />
    <h3>Kit Collins [<a href="#QQ3b+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Currently, the City has incredibly scarce resources for households that are struggling with housing costs or displacement. To our shame, the City has to refer residents struggling with these problems to regional nonprofits and NGOs, which near-constantly have incredibly long waitlists of people who need this type of aid. The City must bring housing stability services in-house instead of referring residents to nonprofits that are already overburdened. I advocate for developing and allocating resources towards an Office of Housing Stability so that when residents facing housing issues or displacement find themselves in those situations, there is actually somewhere in City Hall where they can find help.</p>

<p>Over the long-term, I believe that the most important thing we can do to this end is to use zoning reform to boost housing production and to create a bigger tax base, with which we can provide more comprehensive, in-house social support to help residents afford housing and help prevent them against displacement. In the shorter term, I would continue to vote to fund nonprofits that help tenants and to provide funds to prevent displacement (be it through rental assistance, legal aid, etc.). I would vote to fund the Affordable Housing Trust which we passed this council term and would ensure that the Housing Stability Notification Ordinance which we passed this term as well is well-executed. I would support efforts to create an Office of Housing Stability and would continue to push our City to do better at communicating resources and rights, exploring different channels and languages.</p>

    <a name="4+City_CouncilZac_Bears" />
    <h3>Zac Bears [<a href="#QQ4+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Much of my above plan for preventing displacement also assists people facing homelessness. But, people who are going unhoused face different circumstances and require more resources. The city needs to work with our neighbors to bring a warming center and shelter into Medford. Pairing this with the one-stop shop for social service organizations would significantly improve our ability to help people find permanent housing.</p>
    <a name="4+City_CouncilAnna_Callahan" />
    <h3>Anna Callahan [<a href="#QQ4+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>I would have information available for people about nearby shelters and assistance centers like the Somerville Homeless Coalition and the Malden Warming Center. I also want Medford to have something like the Somerville Workforce and Talent Development program where people looking for work in our city can access training and job openings.</p>
    <a name="4+City_CouncilCharles_Patrick_Clerkin" />
    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin [<a href="#QQ4+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Considering their needs would be more immediate than what can be addressed with longer-term housing policies I'd consider presenting them with a package consisting of access to a soup kitchen and homeless shelter, a ticket to get there and some hygiene products.</p>
<p>Also referral to a social worker who are more equipped to handle deeper root causes and recommend areas of lower cost housing. I'd advocate that this tie in with state grants and national immigrations policies so that no one area becomes an attractant for accumulation of a homeless population.</p>
    <a name="4+City_CouncilKit_Collins" />
    <h3>Kit Collins [<a href="#QQ4+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Knowing that the City does not itself hold sufficient resources to meaningfully assist residents encountering housing instability, I work with residents to connect them with local nonprofits, organizations, and experts that offer emergency rental assistance, legal assistance, or organizing support. When residents do not know where to turn or who to ask for help, I seek to serve as a liaison who can connect them with the right people and resources based on what they need at that moment.</p>
<p>In my first term I have (unfortunately) had a few opportunities to work with Medford households who are experiencing housing instability. For example, when notices to quit were issued en masse to residents of a Bradlee Road apartment building, I helped the tenants in their efforts to stay in their homes and negotiate a just resolution – because in a moment of unprecedented housing costs and scarcity, having to get out in 30 days assures displacement from the community. I helped connect the tenants with a housing justice organization, and liaised and supported their year-plus-long efforts to negotiate with their property owners and achieve a just resolution. When we run into the end of our local jurisdiction to affect housing outcomes, at the very least it is our responsibility to be there for our constituents, and assert that they belong here and their presence in our community must be protected. At the same time, we must advocate for State-level legislative changes that will strengthen local protections and resources for tenants and people facing housing instability.</p>
<p>This term, I helped pass a Housing Stability Notification Ordinance to ensure that more tenants across Medford are informed of their housing rights and local resources – before they need them.</p>
    <a name="4+City_CouncilEmily_Lazzaro" />
    <h3>Emily Lazzaro [<a href="#QQ4+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>The establishment of the Office of Housing Stability would help with this, but I also have many ideas as the Assistant Director of the Malden Warming Center, a seasonal homeless shelter in Malden. People dealing with homelessness or the threat of homelessness need both short-term and long-term assistance. This often is related to substance use disorder and addiction treatment/counseling, but not always. There are barriers to accessing housing if a person has a history of incarceration, for example, or they may be someone who is simply dealing with deep poverty. No matter the situation, wraparound services are useful. There are many wonderful non-profit organizations in our area, but a way to access a collection of services via the city would be a great starting point. Job listings, short term assistance (such as hotel vouchers), connections to places like Eliot Community Human Service, and recovery coaches are all useful. We need to give this issue the attention it deserves and recognize that there isn't a quick fix. We need to work at it, and we need to be stubborn until we have all the services in place that our community needs.</p>

<p>Getting more revenue into the city so that we can have nonprofit/homeless support. Currently, Medford's go-to policy is referring people experiencing homelessness to neighboring municipalities.</p>
    <a name="4+City_CouncilJustin_Tseng" />
    <h3>Justin Tseng [<a href="#QQ4+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>I would work with our Board of Health, city social workers, and the Office of Planning, Development, and Sustainability to tackle these issues and to provide support, be it legal or practical. I think we should dedicate more resources to reaching out to term and seeing what their needs are, which could range from food and clothing to connecting with legal and housing non-profits and job training. I would continue to vote to fund nonprofits that fight against displacement and homelessness and provide food and basics. I also plan to work to establish cooling and warming centers, particularly relevant given extreme weather and climate change and to build more, more accessible public toilets. I would advocate against hostile architecture. I would encourage the Mayor’s office to dedicate a small pool of money that we can use to make sure that food pantries are stocked. I also recognize that a bulk of these actions are geared more at the short-term, and I believe that it’ll take a regional effort – with cities like Medford taking the lead – to create the necessary housing and social protections for a more long-term fix.</p>

    <h3>Kit Collins [<a href="#QQ5b+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Section 8 voucher holders are particularly susceptible to violations of fair housing choice. The City’s Housing Production Plan recommends conducting an updated analysis of barriers to fair housing in Medford to better understand local obstacles for voucher holders finding rentals in our community. Certainly, improved communication and enforcement would help – making sure that all voucher holders know their rights, and that landlords know the consequences for rejecting voucher holders as tenants – and the City has a demonstrated need for better communication and enforcement across the board. In addition, the City should restart the federally-funded housing rehabilitation program and target that funding at units that do not yet comply with HUD Housing Quality Standards, so that those properties may be brought up to eligibility for Section 8 rentals. We currently have a lot of untapped potential in the form of rental units that are not up to HUD standards and are held by landlords that would be happy to accept Section 8 vouchers if they could afford to make their rentals eligible.</p>

I’ve been pushing our city to review its social justice roadmap, and I believe this would fit right into that roadmap. By knowing the facts, we can have a more targeted approach, particularly at a time of low resources. We should work with our Medford Housing Authority and local social justice/civil rights groups to be self-critical. We should also enhance mechanisms by which residents who have encountered housing discrimination can work with city staff to report and rectify the situation. We also have to realize that housing discrimination and the question of fair housing can be subtle and require much listening, nuance, and creativity to solve the problem.</p>

    <p>[ Answer to <a href="#QQ6b+City_Council">main question</a>: Yes ]</p><p>I am strongly in favor of zoning and permitting measures such as an Affordable Housing Overlay that will make it more frictionless to build public and affordable housing in Medford. These are some of the most desperately-needed types of housing in our community, and also some of the most cumbersome and expensive to build. We have a responsibility to make it as easy as possible to build affordable and public housing, so that we may more quickly achieve our goals of housing community neighbors of all backgrounds and income levels.</p>

    <h3>Zac Bears [<a href="#QQ7+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Right now, our major tools are permit fees, CPA funding, and contributions from development projects. I would like to see the State House pass a local option transfer fee bill to allow Medford to fund the AHT through a fee on sales of high priced houses. Additionally, I would support using the general fund operating budget to fund the AHT, and would like to see this contribution grow overtime as the city grows and we see increases to the property tax levy.</p>
    <a name="7+City_CouncilAnna_Callahan" />
    <h3>Anna Callahan [<a href="#QQ7+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>Funds for the trust can come from a variety of sources: Community Preservation Act, linkage fees and transfer fees, short-term rental fees, and state and federal funds (like Community Development Block Grant funds).</p>

    <h3>Charles Patrick Clerkin [<a href="#QQ7+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>I'd like to learn more about it in a context where I can ask questions. If I felt that it was thoughtfully assembled I'd support it by 1) making sure that applications for grants were annually submitted on its behalf 2) keeping the four stakeholder groups (homeowners, landlords, tenants and developers) informed at a bi-annual forum 3) make sure the donation process is easy and 4) provide well-advertised public updates on how the funds are used on the website or in print</p>
    <a name="7+City_CouncilKit_Collins" />
    <h3>Kit Collins [<a href="#QQ7+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>I would support funding the Affordable Housing Trust through appropriations from Community Preservation Act funding, and permitting/mitigation fees from the Condo Conversion Ordinance, should it pass (currently being worked on in subcommittee). I support inclusionary zoning, linkage, and short-term rentals fees being dedicated to the AHT. I am a strong proponent of real estate transfer fees and if the state enables us to enact one, that would be an appropriate and meaningful funding source. I believe our current PILOT agreements with Tufts University and other area nonprofits are insufficient; among other benefits, directing payments into the AHT would start to level the balance.</p>

    <h3>Justin Tseng [<a href="#QQ7+City_Council">QUESTION</a>]</h3>
<p>The Affordable Housing Trust is one of the most substantial wins of my first-term on the City Council and something I was proud to support and help pass. To support its funding, we should ensure during the budget process that there is money in the municipal budget that goes into this fund and dedicate Community Preservation Act funds to it. I’d also support seeing what we can dedicate to it with Community Development Block Grant funds. I would also be supportive of creating additional streams of funding dedicated to solving the housing crisis here in Medford, such as with transfer fees and linkage fees.</p>

Tied in with this, I would relegalize buildings that have been made illegal in past rounds of zoning reform, like triple-deckers, give folks the freedom to decide whether or not they want to subdivide a large house into smaller units (for example after all their children move away), look at loosening up ADU regulations even more, take advantage of the intersection with environmental work (for example, incentivize developers to electrify by offering building incentives if they reach certain targets and densifying in less flood-prone area), and study the intersection of zoning with economic justice, looking at how we can adjust our affordability requirements and AMI targets to reach folks who are currently being left out because AMI is too high, perhaps creating a tiered system where developers have different options to reach affordability.</p>

Massachusetts’ failure to legalize rent control signals that commercial landlords’ profits are more important than residents’ financial and physical security. Failing to enact rent control condones leaving renters to the whims of an uncaring market. With wages lagging far behind gentrification and inflation, the lack of reasonable caps on rent increases causes displacement and homelessness.</p>

    <p>[ Answer to <a href="#QQ10e+City_Council">main question</a>: I would support enacting this locally if legislation passes ]</p><p>I'd support this only if the tenant is made to show interest within 2 weeks of notification of the landlord's intent to sell.</p>
<p>On top of that, the tenant must be able to provide their creditworthiness for a loan from three financial institutions within a week of formally showing interest. If they aren't creditworthy or if the landlord would prefer to sell to a more worthy buyer the landlord may proceed on the open market.</p>

    <p>[ Answer to <a href="#QQ10e+City_Council">main question</a>: I personally support this;I would advocate for this to the state legislature;I would support enacting this locally if legislation passes ]</p><p>Yes, I’m strongly in favor of TOPA and have testified in favor of it at the State level. It is a positive thing for individual households and the community overall when buildings remain in the hands of owner-occupiers instead of being gobbled up by large corporate landlords and for-profit flippers, which are increasingly encroaching upon our housing supply. Cities should be empowered to encourage and enable individual households to collectively purchase buildings so that residents are better able to remain in this community and not be displaced when buildings change hands. This is also an exciting way to encourage homeownership. I am working on including a tenant First Right of Refusal provision in the Condo Conversion Ordinance that is currently in subcommittee.</p>
